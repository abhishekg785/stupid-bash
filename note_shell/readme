note_shell
----------

take notes from shell
               -------

Todo :

1. Make the script executable : chmod -x notes
2. Move the shell script to your bin folder i.e /usr/bin (To run the executable from anywhere in the shell! obvious :P)

Start using this stupid note taking thing, if you want :P
Just type notes in the shell and start using it.
